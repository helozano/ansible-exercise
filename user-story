Description

As an automation engineer I want to create a single playbook that deploys an oracle database for south region so I can shorten the time invested

Currently the team (manual process):

- Prepares a manifest.json with the description of the machine resource
- Spins up a new vm
- Joins the computer to the right domain
- Installs the oracle database
- Configures security settings
- Deploys the Database


Acceptance criteria:

- The playbook:  
 - Creates a new vm
 - Joins the resulting computer to a domain
 - Deploys the database

Has an ansible-playbook command to run the playbook
              ansible-playbook â€“i <path inventario> <path playbook>
